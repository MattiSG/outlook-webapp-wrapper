A desktop wrapper for the Outlook email webapp.

Outlook is a pain. The outdated web-based version of Outlook is even worse. However, some companies or agencies will force it unto you. This wrapper aims at alleviating a bit of the pain, by giving the webapp automatic login with 2FA support, a tray/Dock icon, and an unread badge.

## Setup

As of now, you need to edit the `index.js` file with your username and full name.

## Starting the app

`npm install && npm start`
